I enjoy music primarily for its sonic qualities rather than its lyrical content. My favorite sounds are derived from Trap, Drill, Alt R&B, Urbano, Dance, Wave, and Phonk genres.

My most favorite music is modern Hip-Hop and R&B, particularly from the 2010s onward.

I am also heavily influenced by the game Hotline Miami, which is why I'm a big fan of Wave music. While I listen to Hip-Hop when the mood strikes, I have Wave music playing almost constantlyâ€”it feels like I have it on for half of my day.
